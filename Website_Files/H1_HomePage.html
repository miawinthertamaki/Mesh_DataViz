						This project investigates the spatial and temporal makeup of the NYC Mesh WiFi network, a community driven internet network of activist-citizens building a freely accessible, open,
						 wireless physical structure of interconnected routers. NYC Mesh is based in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn and was founded in 2014. The volunteer-run organization currently provides
						  New Yorkers with over 623 active connections, bypassing the need for provision by conventional Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that constitute an oligopoly of internet service in NYC.
						   Through D3 data visualizations, this project will seek to understand how and when the NYC Mesh WiFi network spread and gained momentum.

						<p> Because profit-seeking ISPs such as Spectrum and Optimum have a stranglehold on internet infrastructure, they are able to charge high prices, provide poor service, and distribute uneven quality. NYC Mesh intervenes in this market by directly connecting to the internet backbone (data center in Chinatown) that allows the network to distribute WiFi to members without an ISP. 

							The decentralized network spreads from the bottom up, where each router DIY-mounted to a rooftop becomes a ‘node’ and source of internet access that can then be spread to other nodes. Each router is installed by volunteering community members at the price of a suggested donation. The nodes work in strength in numbers for both product and program management. More nodes mean not only a stronger internet coverage, speed, and affordability, but also a stronger social fabric behind the trust-based community network. More engaged citizens mean that there are more volunteers who help with installs, network maintenance, and community organizing, helping to keep overall operation costs down.

						<p> Mesh nodes must be mounted strategically to maximize height. 
							Below, each node appears within the scatterplot. Drag your mouse over
							nodes and click on a node that appears red. Check out that view!
