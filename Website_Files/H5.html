						As shown by the visualizations, connections of all sizes and strengths — nodes, hubs, and supernodes — are installed consistently throughout time, allowing the NYC Mesh network to fill in the gaps in internet infrastructure and “embrace the fullness of hardware diversity and interconnectivity” (NYC Mesh, 2022). Though NYC Mesh follows a decentralized mesh network model, its structure has been adapted to provide certain centralities that work within the limits of a non-profit, non-ISP organization. This means that NYC Mesh is not a perfect distributed system— there are still many gaps in coverage, especially in the outer-boroughs that need access most. However, the NYC Mesh network operates with the long-run in mind, acknowledging that smaller areas of interconnected mesh will lead to a larger, more even distribution over time. The informal approach driving NYC Mesh’s growth represents a kind of guerilla urbanism: making do with what we have through tactical interventions that ultimately help make digital infrastructure more equitable.

Tactically framed, these panoramas serve as a reminder that digital infrastructure, while often abstract, is ultimately run by and developed for people.
